#About z≃6 quasars
This is a paper about z≃6 quasars. These are z≠0 quasars. Throughout the paper,
we adopt a $Λ$CDM cosmology with $H_{0}=67$\ km\ s$^{-1}$\ Mpc$^{-1}$,
$Ω_M=0.3$, and $Ω_Λ=0.7$ (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014). Unless otherwise
stated, all magnitudes are on the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983) and have been
corrected for Galactic extinction using the reddening map of (Schlafly &
Finkbeiner 2011).
